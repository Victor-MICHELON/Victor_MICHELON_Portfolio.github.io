# Hi there, I'm Victor MICHELON! 👋

### 🎓 Aspiring Data Scientist & ML Engineer
*Engineering Student at ESILV Paris | Applied Mathematics & Computer Science*

**Turning theory into working AI systems.**
I am mastering Data Science & ML through **hands-on, end-to-end engineering**, building a portfolio of projects to bridge the gap between academic concepts and professional AI applications.

## 🚀 Flagship Project

### 🎬 [CineMatch AI](https://github.com/Victor-MICHELON/Nom_Du_Repo_CineMatch)
**Full-Stack Hybrid Recommendation Engine | SOTA NLP | Streamlit**

> *A production-ready recommendation system designed to solve the "Cold Start" problem using semantic understanding.*

**Why this stands out:**
* **🏗️ End-to-End Engineering:** Built from scratch—from raw data pipeline and vector embedding generation to a deployed web application with sub-second query latency.
* **🧠 SOTA NLP Semantic Search:** Leverages **SBERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** to encode movie plots into high-dimensional vectors, capturing implicit "vibes" and nuances that keyword filtering misses.
* **⚡ Hybrid Filtering Architecture:** Implements a weighted ensemble formula combining **Semantic Similarity** (Content-Based) + **Structured Metadata** (Genres/Cast) + **Popularity Metrics**.
* **📊 Interactive UI/UX:** Features a glassmorphism design with dynamic **Plotly Radar Charts** to visually explain recommendations to the user (Explainable AI).

🛠️ **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, SBERT (Transformers), Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas.

## 📂 Other Featured Projects

### 🧬 [Brain Tumor Detection (XAI)](https://github.com/Victor-MICHELON/Brain_Tumor_Classification)
**Computer Vision & Medical Imaging Classification with a focus on Explainable AI.**
Moving beyond "black box" models by implementing Grad-CAM to visualize *where* the model looks when detecting tumors.

* **Architecture:** Comparison between Custom CNNs vs. Transfer Learning (EfficientNetB0).
* **Interpretability:** Integrated **Grad-CAM** heatmaps to validate model focus on tumor regions, ensuring scientific rigor.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Keras, Computer Vision (CNN), Grad-CAM.

### 🌊 [Tsunami Risk Prediction](https://github.com/Victor-MICHELON/Tsunami_Risk_Prediction_Model)
**Predicting natural disasters with high precision to aid early warning systems.**
A supervised learning project focused on classifying seismic events based on their potential to generate tsunamis.

* **Performance:** Achieved **F1-score of 90%** and **Recall of 95%** (prioritizing safety/false positives).
* **Highlight:** Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to correlate magnitude and depth with risk levels using geospatial clustering.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Geopandas (Spatial Data), Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.
